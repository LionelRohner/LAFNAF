Linear Algebra Functions That Nobody Asked For, But Here They Are.

Originally, I wrote these functions to verify some linear algebra exercises. As the number of functions grew, I created this repository. The functions are not efficient (it's plain R-code) nor have they been thoroughly tested. Besides, all these functions have been implemented more efficiently in other packages or even in base R. It is just a fun exercise for me to get a better understanding of linear algebra.
